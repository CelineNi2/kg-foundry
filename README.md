# kg-foundry
kg-foundry is a modern end-to-end pipeline for transforming unstructured textual documents (articles, newsletters, reports) into a high-quality, validated and visualizable Knowledge Graph.

The project combines state-of-the-art techniques including:

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- LLM-based entity & relation extraction
- Entity linking & canonicalization
- Confidence scoring & fusion
- SHACL-based validation and refinement
- Iterative optimization approaches inspired by recent research
- JavaScript graph visualization (Cytoscape.js / Sigma.js)

kg-foundry aims to be:
- Reliable — provenance-rich extraction, strong validation
- Modular — clean interfaces for ingestion, extraction, validation, storage and visualization
- Research-driven — built on scientific best practices in knowledge-infused learning and KG refinement
- Developer-friendly — easy to run, extend and integrate into real pipelines
